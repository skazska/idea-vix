# Main:
1. Get instrument able to visualize data, information, concepts, ideas
2. Make competitive or likeable instrument

## What to visualize:
- [Data][1]
- [Information][1]
- Concepts and ideas

## How to visualize:

<table>
<tr><td>Data</td><td>Information</td></tr>
<tr><td>tables, plots, charts, diagrams, maps, graphs</td><td>diagrams, maps, graphs, infographics, animations</td></tr>
</table>

Concepts and ideas: compositions of artefacts and their relations

## Form of result:
Assuming:
- service - is a software application that has a user interface or api to be used by customers
- tool - is a library or framework that has an api to be used by developers or other tools or services

1. draw tool to generate drawing fundamentals (dots, lines, shapes, text, images, layouts, etc)
1. presentation tool to generate widgets consisting of drawings (table, plot, chart, diagram, map)
1. data visualization service
1. information visualization service
1. concept and idea visualization service

## Croudstanding:
1. Programmability?
1. Dynamics, Animability? Streams?
1. Smart widget generation?

## Definitions:
### Concepts and ideas visualisation
As composition of artefacts and their relations visualisation consists of
1. layouts defining positions, orientations and effects related to position only
2. artefacts representing somethings as items placed in positions of layout
3. relations drawings or effects representing relations between artefacts in positions

### Information visualisation
As of [definition][1]. 
> Multiple, large-scale and complicated datasets which contain quantitative (numerical) data as well as qualitative (non-numerical, i.e. verbal or graphical) and primarily abstract data.

For the sake of this project, we consider information as set of data describing facts and not an idea or concept.



### Data visualisation
- value series
  - 
- record series
- time series
- 

- Data series visualization
  - Time series
  - Graphs
  - Tables
  - Charts
- Data streams visualization
- Attribute based display
